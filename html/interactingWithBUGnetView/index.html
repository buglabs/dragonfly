<h1>Interacting with the BUGnet View</h1>
The BUGnet view allows you to interact with the BUG community on <a href="http://www.buglabs.net/applications">BUGnet</a>. 
You can browse, upload, or download applications via our Web Service interface that connects to: http://api.buglabs.net

<ul>
	<li>Left click on any application to bring up the BUGnet application details page in a Physical Editor window.

	<li>Click the 'Search Applications' <img src="../images/app_search.gif" border="0"/> button to load the Community Applications page in a Physical Editor window.

</ul>

<h2>Latest Apps</h2>
This section displays the latest updated applications on BUGnet and has a Search box (queries application name, username, tags fields) to help you find applications.
<h2>Applications by Modules</h2>
This section displays when a Physical Editor is opened for any BUG Connection (see: <a href="../interactingWithMyBUGsView/index.html">MyBUGs view</a> for details). 
It returns a list of applications based on the modules attached to BUG. When a user has multiple BUG Connections this section displays for the last active Physical Editor.
