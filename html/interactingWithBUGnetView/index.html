<h1>Interacting with the BUGnet View</h1>
The BUGnet view allows you to interact with the BUG community on <a href="http://www.buglabs.net/applications">BUGnet</a>. 
You can browse, upload, or download applications via our Web Service interface that connects to: https://api.buglabs.net

	<li>Do a full text search for all applications, your applications, or applications for a connected BUG in the BUGnet view search box.</li>
</ul><br>
If you accidentally close this view you can go to Window > Show View > Other > Dragonfly > BUGnet to display it again.

<ul>
	<li>Enable BUGnet - checkbox that allows you to go into offline mode.</li>
	<li>Server Name - The web service URL to buglabs.net.</li>
	<li>Number of Applications to display - Accepts 0 to 100. This changes the number of applications displayed in the My Apps and Top Apps sections.</li>
	<li>Clear Authentication Data - Clears saved BUGnet Authentication and logs you out of your current session.</li>
</ul>

The BUGnet view contains a login to BUGnet link, a search filter drop-down which defaults to All Applications, a search box, and a list of applications that can be downloaded to the SDK.

<h3>Login to BUGnet</h3>

	You can enter an existing BUGnet Username and Password and click OK (Optional: check the 'save authentication' checkbox). 
	If you don't have BUGnet account you can click the <a href="http://www.buglabs.net/signup">here</a> link to create one.
    

<h3>Search Filter</h3>
The Search Filter has the following choices:
<ul>
<li>All Applications: Shows all applications on BUGnet that match the search terms.  If the search box is empty, it will return all applications.</li>
<li>My Applications: Shows all applications for which you are an administrator or collaborator.  If you select this filter prior to logging in, you will be presented with the BUGnet Authentication window and asked to log in.</li>
<li>Applications for My BUGs: If you have a real or virtual BUG connected to the SDK, they will appear as a list here.  If you have no BUGs connected, then you will not see this filter.  This filter allows you to search only for applications that will run on the connected BUG chosen, based on the modules attached to the connected BUG.
</ul>

<h3>Search Box</h3>
Entering a search term in the Search Box and clicking "Search" will return a list of applications based on that search term and the above filter.  The search terms can be cleared with the 'X' button.  Searching without a search term will return all results based on the above filter.

<h3>Application List</h3>
This list shows the search results based on the Search Box and Search Filter above.  The list returns a default number of results, which can be set in the BUGnet Preferences.  At the bottom of the list, the number of results shown is displayed.  If the number of results available is greater than the number of results shown, a link to "View more" is available.  Clicking this link will add more applications to the current results list.
